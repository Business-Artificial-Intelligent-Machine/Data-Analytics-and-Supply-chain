Title: Data analytics and supply chain for fisheries.

Without proper statistics or adequate analyzation of our progress there is no scope for improvement or success in any field. Hence, I propose a project to analyze the pre-existing data of fishermen and provide statistical overview of finance and work. My simple plan is to store data of fishermen (Expenses, types of fish, present market rate, future prediction) into a database and provide statistical output which does help the fishermen improve their profits. For example, if there are any expenses spent upon fishing by the fishermen, the fishermen needs to enter the expenses and the category of expenses like Feed or Nets, the data entered will be stored into the database and will be analyzed to display statistical results. To be user-friendly and platform independent for the fishermen, I wish to either develop a web page or to create a java Aplet using awt and Sql database. If time permits, I further wish to develop a mobile application which might definitely be handy for the fishermen.
